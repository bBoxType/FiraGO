# FiraGO 1.0 *NEW*

- 15 weights, 2 styles (Roman & Italic)

## New family name
For [several reasons](https://github.com/bBoxType/FiraGO/blob/master/FiraGO_FiraSans_Comparison.pdf), we decided to establish FiraGO as a new product. That way users of FiraSans can also install FiraGO without any conflict.

__* Note on thin weight fractional coordinates__

All weights below “Thin” use fractional coordinates which is an optical decision. Rendering engines might not be able to deal with that correctly. As for that, these weights should be seen as an experiment by now. If you notice any problems in smaller sizes please consider to use weights from Thin.
